# Python-Interpreter

Developed an interpreter for Python programs simulating computer’s execution, using basic operators & OOPs in Python
 
It is capable of processing Unary and Binary Operations, Conditionals, as well as nested loops using Branch statements.

Part-1 : 
A STATEMENT is of the form: VARIABLE = EXPRESSION

EXPRESSION is one of:

• TERM

• UNARY OPERATOR TERM

• TERM BINARY OPERATOR TERM

Part-2 :
A STATEMENT is one of:

• VARIABLE = EXPRESSION

• while EXPRESSION :
 STATEMENT LIST
    
As in Python, the “while EXPRESSION :” occurs on a line by itself, followed by STATEMENT LIST, with one statement on each line. The STATEMENTS that form the STATEMENT LIST, are offset by an additional TAB (the ’\t’ character)
